- Loading button -> (Done by GhostWanted)

- Only one radio must work -> (Done by GhostWanted)

- Add order to tabs

- Make a global variable that will hold the current activated radio.
This way we can remove $( ".radio-item" ).removeClass("active"); which is a loop over the radio items.

- Try to hold every thing in one loop in the popup.js

- Fixed this wrong code:
	function clickItem() {
		$( ".radio-item" ).click(function() {
		...
	...
becasue clickItem is the function that will be called when the item is clicked
and .click is also a function that will be called when the item is clicked.
So..., basically, we are dealing with some sort of Inception.
